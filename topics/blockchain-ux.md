#  Is there a blockchain UX? 

# Introduction:  Blockchain UX: hype or hope? 

In February, IDEO, a top technology design firm, announced a blockchain venture to fund DLT startups and design thinking [1](https://www.businessinsider.com/ideo-turning-to-blockchain-2019-2).

That blockchain needs “UX” is not a given. Of course plenty of designers want a foot in the blockchain door and are pushing for the benefits of UX involvement. 

But there is the opposite view, that blockchain doesn't represent any special UX problems; its just the engine.  That consumers care about the experience, but are ambivelant about the underlying technology.

Today we dig into the question what is UX for blockchain?
Is it a marketing ploy to make glossy eyecandy to grab a piece of the VC money chasing BC?  Or, do DLT present a new UX.

Many bc wallets are little more than developed GUI for an API, designed to demonstrate the mechanics.   transparency. Clean design to make nice sale presentations.

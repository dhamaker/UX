# Introduction:  Blockchain UX: hype or hope? 

In February, the design firm IDEO announced a blockchain venture firm to combine design thinking and DLT [1](https://www.businessinsider.com/ideo-turning-to-blockchain-2019-2).
DLT Identity experts call for more “UX” is needed. And of course plenty of UX desingers are pushing for greater UX involvement. 
But there is the opposite view, that blockchain doesn't represent any special UX problems; that like a database, users don't care what you run your service on

Today we dig into the question what is UX for blockchain?
Is this just Marketing ploy to get a piece of the money chasing bc bandwagon?

Many bc wallets are little more than developed GUI for an API, designed to demonstrate the mechanics.   transparency. Clean design to make nice sale presentations.

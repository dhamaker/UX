# Introduction

# Blockchain UX: hype or hope? 

Early this year, IDEO, an international design firm, announced a special venture to fund DLT startups and design thinking [(1)](https://www.businessinsider.com/ideo-turning-to-blockchain-2019-2).  
You don't have to search hard to find designers lobbying for user experience (UX) services as essential to mass adoption - and realization of the transformative promise.

At the same time, many argue blockchain is infrastructure and doesn't need UX design. While consumers care about experience, they don't directly experience the ledger.  but are ambivelant about the underlying technology.

Project funding is finite.  So, is UX critical or just another drain for investment.  Just another voice seeking a piece of the pie. hoping to catch the blockchain wave. 

Today we dig into the question what is UX for blockchain?


Is it a marketing ploy to make glossy eye candy to grab a piece of the VC money chasing BC?  Or, do DLT present a new UX.

Is there a role for UX in a blockchain project?  
If there is what is it and how should you budget?

Many bc wallets are little more than developed GUI for an API, designed to demonstrate the mechanics.   transparency. Clean design to make nice sale presentations.

* usability.  need to look at incremental impact.  any new application should have UX, but is there a special blockchain UX
* investors and presentations.  -- is really more brand design; you want the investors to identify with look.
* ux research, ethnography, 
* ux design in early stages overlaps service/process/business design.
* what's the use case, many DLT transformation are middleware replacements - using DLT to streamline transactions/records between systems.
* Performance is fundamental UX issue, but mostly an engineering challenge.
* nature of architecture impacts UX: public/federated, custodial/hardware/physical,
* lifecycle - investors, early adoptors, mass audience....

COST OF UX PROBLEMS: lower adoption, lost coin, abandoned accounts, increased service calls,

# Compliance First
> WORKING DRAFT 

It's time Compliance First.  We've had lots of design trends mobile first, privacy by design, accessibility, web 2.0, customer experience, usability testing.  These tend confuse our business colleagues and make it look as if our profession is confused.  Compliance First unites them all.  One... to rule them all.

## Respect for the rights of others
* Steve Jobs and Think Different
* Founding Fathers "...all men... inalienable rights... among these... life, liberty, and pursuite of happiness... we pledge our lives, fortunes, and sacred honor"
* Pledge of alegience, "I pledge alegience to ...  liberty and justice for all."
* Equality access, commerce, participation
* Equality, liberty, and venture capitial 

## Equality
* accessibility. wcag, best practice
* ecomomic access.  web is a public social and interstate commerce space. cost of conent = (time to load  * hourly wage) + (page weight * 
* data cost) + access fee
* digital divide and content that breaks older tech and forces consumers to spend


## Privacy

* Transparent about site privacy / your business model
* design for privacy first


## Compliance
* Burden vs Benefit.  Reactive v. Proactive.  Remediate v. Design

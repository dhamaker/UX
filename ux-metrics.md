# UX Metrics
How can we tell if a needs improvement or is better?  How do we set design goals that are measureable?  

Sometimes subjective reasons are all it takes: "the owner likes blue, so repaint it".  But most of the time, we need to justify our budget.  Why do we need three UX designers?  Why should we spend $200,000 rebuilding our portal?

Your UX metrics need to reflect your business model.

Sites funded by advertising model, volume adn stickiness is a key success factor.    On a support site, increased traffic and stickiness can mean worsening services; your service goal may be enjoy a hassel free (offline) product.  



Traditional UX metrics include

* adoption 
* conversion
* reach
* traffic
* impressions
* accessibility
* stickiness

UX Manager should measure user cost of access
* User's time
* User's data cost
* Risk of bad UX.  Say potential damange to trust and brand reputation if needs are not met, or trust is undermined from bad UX.
* Risk of non-compliance


Data costs = Page size * Cost per MB.
Users time = Avg page load time * Avg user wage

Example: to access B2B services user must visit home page and log in.  Cost to your customers is

data costs = $/GB
wages = $/hr

example customer cost = pageviews * (cost of data + cost of time)
  = pageviews * ((page size * data cost) + (avg page load time * wages))
  
 example: scale of site can mean large economic impact. Consider a B2B site increase in load time of 1 second on a site with 10,000,000 pageview a month assuming the user is being paid minimum wager.
 
 cost per second:  $15 / 360 = 0.04 cents
 increased cost per month = 10,000,000 * .04 = $400,000
 Increased cost per year = $4,800,000
 
 That is a hard cost to your customer.  Consider the about that the next time you look at adding new images, javascript library, or tracking beacon.

# UX Metrics
How can we tell if a needs improvement or is better?  How do we set design goals that are measureable?  

Sometimes subjective reasons are all it takes: "the owner likes blue, so repaint it".  But most of the time, we need to justify our budget.  Why do we need three UX designers?  Why should we spend $200,000 rebuilding our portal?

Your UX metrics need to reflect your business model.

Sites funded by advertising model, volume adn stickiness is a key success factor.    On a support site, increased traffic and stickiness can mean worsening services; your service goal may be enjoy a hassel free (offline) product.

UX Manager should measure user cost of access
